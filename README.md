# leaflet-challenge

This repository contains javascript code that pulls earthquake data from the USGS at "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/2.5_month.geojson" and plots it on an OpenStreetMap using D3 and Leaflet.  

Earthquake magnitude is represented by the size of each marker, and earthquake depth is represented by each marker's color.  

Code for making the map legend was borrowed from:  "https://codepen.io/haakseth/pen/KQbjdO".
